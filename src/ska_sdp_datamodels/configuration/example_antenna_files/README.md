# Antenna configuration files

This directory contains example antenna files, which can be used to
generate Configuration() data model objects using the 
`ska_sdp_datamodels.configuration.create_configuration_from_file` and 
`ska_sdp_datamodels.configuration.create_named_configuration` functions.

They were migrated from [RASCIL](https://ska-telescope.gitlab.io/external/rascil/). 
They need to be used with caution as they are not maintained, however
they are useful for testing purposes.
